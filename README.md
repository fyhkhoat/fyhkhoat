My **hobbies** are:

For the moment, I coach students for their robotics project, for instance *how to make a blinker with LEDs*.  
Here is an example code for it:  
```C++
const int broche13=13;
void setup ()
{
pinMode (broche13, OUTPUT);
}
void loop ()
{
digitalWrite (broche13, HIGH);
delay (1000);
digitalWrite (broche13, LOW);
delay (1000);
```
